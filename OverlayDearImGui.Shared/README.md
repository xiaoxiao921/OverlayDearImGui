# OverlayDearImGui.Shared

Creates an overlay window that renders [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) over the process of your choice.

Does not work when the target application is exclusively full-screen.

For an example implementation check out the `OverlayDearImGui.BepInEx5` C# Project.
